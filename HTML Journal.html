Boilerplate: (shortcut is "html")
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
This is the most basic essentials for a website! The <head></head> is where you put all the information that you want to give to the browser to tell it how to process your content.
  <body></body> is where all your content goes that is viewed by the site visitors.
-----
<br> is a line break, so you would use this to add space in between text.
-----
<p></p> means paragraph, and is the main chunk of where text is on a website.
-----
For headers, there are 6 different sizes: (largest)<h1></h1>,<h2></h2>,<h3></h3>,<h4></h4>,<h5></h5>,<h6></h6>(smallest)
-----
<strong></strong> is used to add bold to text, while <em></em> is for italisizing text.
-----
<hr> is a line that goes across the page to act as a breaker. The default size is 1 pixel but you can give it attributes to make it whatever you like!
-----
<ul>
  <li>listed item</li>
  <li>other listed item</li>
  <li>other OTHER listed item</li>
</ul>
This is an "unorganized list", it usually comes out at a bullet-pointed list. However if you want to make a numbered list you can use:
<ol>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
</ol>
